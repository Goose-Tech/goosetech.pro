#### DESCRIPTION

In this video I show how to setup your own Ether-1 Service / Masternode for their IPFS network. These nodes provide the storage space for the webhosted content on the network. The steps are all provided on the Ether-1 website, but the video shows each step in detail.

*The value of crypto currencies is constantly changing. If the value of a coin goes up, node can be a good source of passive income, however, if the price goes down, they could end up costing you in the longrun. Please do your own research to determine if running a service/masternode is worthwhile.
