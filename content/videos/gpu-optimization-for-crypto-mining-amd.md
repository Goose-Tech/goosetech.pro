#### VIDEO

&nbsp;

#### DESCRIPTION

How to optimize your AMD GPU for mining using Radeon/Adrenalin software.  Also suggested is MSI Afterburner, but not required.  In this video I show how I adjust my GPU settings to reduce heat while maintaining an acceptable hashrate for mining crypto currency.

This is a response to those who commented with questions on my previous Awesome Miner videos.
