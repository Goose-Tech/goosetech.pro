#### DESCRIPTION

Special delivery = higher profits in mining? I'll take it! A special thanks for everyone at the Pickaxe.Pro mining pool and Pickaxe.mn Shared Masternode site. Keep up the good work!

NOTE: This is a fan tribute video. The Pickaxe coin does not actually do anything besides look amazing on my desk. :-)

Some back-story...  
PickAxe.Pro was started by tarballqc & jefke, who were among the first members of my Goose-Tech Discord server. They saw some of my videos and wanted to create their own mining pool. I tried to promote their efforts whenever I could--especially when they added a new coin algorithm to their pool. To further promote their brand, they decided to sell merchandise. One of the first items they offered was an official PickAxe.Pro collector's coin, which was featured in this video.

Sadly, PickAxe.Pro closed its doors in September 2019. They had a great run, having started the pool around March 2018. Here is a quote from tarballqc announcing the pool will be going offline:

`"tarballqc09/05/2019
@everyone We said we were going to try to reduce infrastructure cost and keep running Pickaxe pool... based on the feedback we had from you guys. We really wanted to keep our baby on artificial breathing... and hope to last as long as possible. But we have come to a fact that it's not possible.  Having that (clumsily) said, I have to announce that the pool will go offline, this Friday September 6th. Of course, we will make sure everyone get their last payout before the website goes offline."`

And now...a moment of silence for the late, great mining pool...
