#### DESCRIPTION

This is a video of me replacing a defective HDD with an SSD in a Dell Inspiron 3147, proceeding to re-install a fresh copy of Windows 8.1, upgrade that to Windows 10 Home, perform a clean install of Windows 10 Home, and finally install Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon while keeping Windows as the primary boot loader and OS.
