#### DESCRIPTION

In this video I show how to password protect remote management in Claymore's Dual Ethereum Miner with Awesome Miner. While this error message is mostly benign on a local network, if a user were to expose the remote management port to the internet, it could pose a potential security risk. This video addresses how to quickly and easily fix this issue and secure the miner.
