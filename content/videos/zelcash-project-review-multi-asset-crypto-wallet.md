#### VIDEO

{{< youtube zYQZI619xug >}}

&nbsp;

#### DESCRIPTION

This is a review of the ZelCash crypto project and what they have to offer. The ZelCore Wallet is a fully encrypted, multi-asset wallet that brings a whole new level of convenience like username and password for easy, cross-platform access to your funds, including Android and iOS versions. A future decentralized exchange and decentralized app platform will make use of a sophisticated node system. Lots of potential for this project!

In an effort to remain as objective as possible, I have not solicited any funds from ZelCash to make this video. I have also disabled monetization on this video. Please feel free to share this video to help spread the word and show your support for ZelCash.
