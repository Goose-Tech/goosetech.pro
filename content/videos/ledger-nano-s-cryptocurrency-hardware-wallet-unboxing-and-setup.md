#### DESCRIPTION

It's been a long time coming, but finally an unboxing, review, and setup video for the Ledger Nano S Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet. This is one of the most highly rated hardware wallets for some of the most popular cryptocurrencies. In this video, I go into the details of how to set up the device and transfer crypto to it. Anyone can do this!

(Sorry for strange "pops" in the audio.  I must have a bad cable.)
