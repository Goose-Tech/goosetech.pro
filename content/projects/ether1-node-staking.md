The Ether-1 Project is a heavily modified fork of Etherum seeking to provide a fully functional, decentralized webhosting solution for affordable hosting of websites and/or files on an IPFS network. The project already has a working product called ethoFS, which allows the easy upload of a single file or folder to Ether-1's decentralized node network. Since the files are hosted on nodes run by the community, it is a completely decentralized model of file storage and sharing. Once a file/folder has been uploaded to ethoFS, the owner is given a unique hash link to the content, which can then be used to direct a domain to the content or shared privately with other users. The content is accessible from anywhere in the world.

Since the node network is required to store content, more nodes will be needed to host the data. Ether-1 is unique since it offers this added service through the node layer, but since it is a fork of Ethereum, carries with it added functionality through smart contracts. The node layer has been built entirely from users staking the required amount via smart contracts. Through the use of smart contracts, it is also possible for a stakeholder to provide the collateral for another user to start a node. The Ether-1 Staking Portal provides an opportunity for stakeholders and node operators to earn together.

Essentially, a stakeholder provides the collateral, while the borrower provides the server for the node. The smart contract, signed by both parties, handles the reward split: 90% to the node operator, 10% to the stakeholder. The terms of the split can be adjusted for each stakeholder according to their needs. I have connected my own copy of the staking portal here.
