# Markdown Template for Ether-1 ECP (Ether-1 Community Proposal)

---

This is a simple markdown template for submitting ECPs to the Ether-1 Project Official GitHub Repository, which may be found [here](https://github.com/Ether1Project/ECPs/issues). The purpose of this template is to display these submissions on the [Ether-1 News Website](https://github.com/Ether1Project/ECPs) hosted on GitHub.

The Ether-1 motto is "Decentralize Everything!" To that end, the project has focused heavily on providing a decentralized alternative to webhosting through the use of their own IPFS (Inter-planetary File System) node network and smart contracts. Learn more at [https://ether1.org](https://ether1.org).
